    <h1>Welcome!</h1>
    <h2>Angular April</h2>
    <h3>4 Projects in 4 Weeks</h3>
    <ul>
      <li>Personal Website: More than a portfolio, this website will include the features of an organizer like a to-do list, address book, and calendar.</li>
      <li>Small Business Website: In addition to standard business pages like 'about' and 'services' we will add a client list and appointment scheduling.</li>
      <li>Online Store: Think of it like 'Amazon Light'. We will build an online catalog with search and recommendation features as well as a shopping cart, order form, and customer history.</li>
      <li>Community Website: A theme-based website that provides friends, followers, timelines, community announcements, and discussion forums.</li>
    </ul>
