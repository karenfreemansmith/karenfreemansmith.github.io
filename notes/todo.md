## Friday Projects
1. Add a computed property: such as number of votes for an answer (maybe number of answers per question?), sorting by answers or votes...maybe the random answer(s) from our mascot(s)?
2. Add a helper: nicely formatted timestamp, some kind of icon or formatting to indicate questions with no answers yet, or most answered questions.
3. Add a service: let user save favorite questions? Maybe have some kind of authentication for the user (save user info?)
4. (Optional additions)
  A. Up/down vote answers and sorting by rank
  B. Create admin area (but for what?)
