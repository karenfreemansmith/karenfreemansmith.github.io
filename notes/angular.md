## Basic Structure of an Angular App
Angular apps are built with components. There is a main component that *is* the app, and it can contain any number of components within it (and also each component can contain other components, nesting as many levels as you need).

**Data Down** Data is passed down from the parent component to it's children components.

**Actions Up** Actions are passed up from the child components to their parent component.

Routing is the term used for how components are located and called.
